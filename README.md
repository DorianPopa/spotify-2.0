## Spotify 2.0

This is a fun side-project that I made in order to practice my [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) skills and to pick up a few more skills on the way.

The app is a Spotify client that uses the Spotify API to provide access to playlists, songs and audio streaming (still work in progress). 

A Spotify account is needed in order to use the application.

## Tech stack
 - [Next.js 12](https://nextjs.org/)
 - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
 - [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
 - [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
 - [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/) - will be used for in-browser audio streaming

## Live version

I will deploy the app on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) and update this description with a link to the live version of the application.
